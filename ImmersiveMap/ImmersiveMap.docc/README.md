runtime assets.

## May Contain

- DocC Markdown articles.
- Public API overviews and usage examples.
- Public-safe diagrams or resources required by DocC documentation.
- Generic configuration examples that do not include real credentials.

## Must Not Contain

- Bearer tokens, Mapbox access tokens, private URLs, or local environment notes.
- Internal stand documentation, database credentials, or generated secret files.
- Build artifacts, screenshots from private sessions, or DerivedData.
- Hand-written Swift, Metal, Proto, or renderer implementation files.
- Host-app-specific instructions that are not relevant to the package docs.
